# Assembler Project (C)

This project was developed as part of the Open University course "Systems Programming Lab" (20465).

## Description
A two-stage assembler written in C for a custom assembly language.  
The project includes preprocessing for macro expansion, parsing of assembly source files, symbol handling, syntax validation, and translation into machine code output files.

## Features
- Macro preprocessing
- First pass and second pass assembly process
- Syntax and semantic validation
- Symbol table handling
- Output generation for machine code and symbol-related files
- Support for sample valid and invalid assembly inputs

## Project Structure
- `assembler.c` - main program
- `pre_processor.c` / `pre_processor.h` - macro preprocessing
- `first_transition.c` / `first_transition.h` - first pass
- `second_transition.c` / `second_transition.h` - second pass
- `syntax_utility.c` - syntax-related helpers
- `file_utility.c` - file handling helpers
- `structs.c` - data structure helpers
- `makefile` - build file

## Build
Compile with:

```bash
make
